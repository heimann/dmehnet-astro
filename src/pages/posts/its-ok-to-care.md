You might be told to focus on the things that matter. You might be told that Uber’s website looked awful when it launched. You might be told that no one will care if the login screen looks slightly off in Microsoft Edge.

Today I spent four hours of my Saturday night polishing the hell out of one animation for part of a login flow. I don’t know if it’s ever going to see the light of day, and I don’t think it really matters. There are certain things that add up, to make the sum greater than its part and there’s nothing that transforms an experience more than care. 

Care oozes out of whatever you build. And because of the incentives that have created the world we live in, and the software development hell we’re in, care is at an all time premium. 

Ok I say that but then you see things like Linear. I wish our stuff at Ressemble looked anything close to as good as Linear’s stuff does. Or idk, the Family crypto wallet, that thing looks incredible. Some part of it is definitely just being short on time and capital, but is there a part of it that signifies a lack of care? It’s tough to know. I certainly hope not, I like to believe that I care.

I don’t have the answers but I think it’s important to say out loud that it’s okay to care and caring makes a big difference, especially caring about the little things. 

Actually no, it's not just ok to care... It's a moral imperative. You should care.
