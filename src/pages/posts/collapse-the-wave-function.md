I’ve noticed that by default, I’ll go through life while trying to maintain optionality. Partially this is just a prudent decision, to not make any decisions until you have to, as Randy Pausch says in [The Last Lecture](https://www.cmu.edu/randyslecture/)

Still, there’s a weird form of regression to the mean that happens when you avoid committing yourself to things. It’s hard to define it precisely. It’s almost as if the fact that you’re not letting your mind focus down into a singular point dilutes the quality of your overall thinking. This then degrades your behavior and ability to take fruitful action.

So, my new mode for 2024 is collapsing the wave function. Like in quantum mechanics, sort of. Point being, I'm going to attempt to avoid living in a superposition afraid to commit to stuff.
