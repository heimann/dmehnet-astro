  <p class="mt-0">Hi there! I'm David Heimann, a computer programmer in Brooklyn, NY.</p>
  <p>
    This is my corner of the internet. I won't make any promises about what
    you'll find here, but I generally try to make it a place that I would enjoy
    if I stumbled onto it myself. I also find it helpful to use it to clarify my
    own thinking, a sort of map for where I am and where I might be going.

    I like making things with computers. The fact that we have this incredible
    tool at our fingertips, where we can alter the world around us with a few
    keystrokes never ceases to amaze me. Most of all, I like making things that
    help people understand the world around them better, or that helps them make
    things themselves!

    Recently, I've been working on <a href="https://links.rip"
      >a new kind of bookmarking website</a
    > that works more like fuzzy search on top of a text conversation than a catalogue.
