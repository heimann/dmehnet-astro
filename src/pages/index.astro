      <p>Hi there! I'm David Heimann, a computer programmer in Brooklyn, NY.</p>
      <p class="mt-4">This is my corner of the internet. I won't make any promises about what you'll find here, but I generally try to make it a place that I would enjoy if I stumbled onto it myself. I also find it helpful to use it to clarify my own thinking, a sort of map for where I am and where I might be going. </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        I'm currently working on the software team at <a href="https://impilo.health">Impilo</a>. Before that I built
        <a href="https://brus.ai">Brus</a> and
        <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2016/03/with-purple-you-can-get-election-updates-and-political-info-via-text/">Purple</a>, which we
        <a href="https://www.axios.com/theskimm-purple-acquisition-texting-email-52cad29c-5374-46e4-8155-b7410d734bf8.html">sold to theSkimm</a>
        in 2019.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">I like making things with computers. The fact that we have this incredible tool at our fingertips, where we can alter the world around us with a few keystrokes never ceases to amaze me. Most of all, I like making things that help people understand the world around them better, or that helps them make things themselves! </p>
      <p class="mt-4">Recently, I've been working on <a href="https://links.rip">a new kind of bookmarking website</a> that works more like fuzzy search on top of a text conversation than a catalogue.</p>
      <p class="mt-4">You can find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/davidmeh">Twitter</a> and on <a href="https://github.com/heimann">Github</a>.</p>
