<BaseLayout pageTitle={pageTitle}>
  <h1 class="text-2xl tracking-tight font-bold">Books</h1>
  <p>
    I spend a good amount of my time reading and often end up talking book
    recommendations with friends. There's a growing number of people on the
    internet putting up their book lists for others to browse. While I am a fan
    of the idea behind it I find it can be kind of paralyzing to look at a list
    of dozens of books.
  </p>
  <p>
    This page is a bit of an experiment. Every time you load the page you will
    be presented with five books at random from my bookshelf. The list of books
    is not exhaustive nor have I read all of the books that I own, but my hope
    is that someone might find inspiration for their next book.
  </p>

  <ul id="bookList" class="list-disc pl-5 pt-4"></ul>

  <script define:vars={{ books }}>
    function shuffleArray(array) {
      for (let i = array.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
        const j = Math.floor(Math.random() * (i + 1));
        [array[i], array[j]] = [array[j], array[i]];
      }
      return array;
    }

    function displayRandomBooks() {
      const bookList = document.getElementById("bookList");
      const randomBooks = shuffleArray([...books]).slice(0, 5);

      bookList.innerHTML = randomBooks
        .map(
          (book) => `
        <li class="mb-2">
          <a href="${book["Purchase Link"]}" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">
            ${book.Title}
          </a>
          ${book.Rating ? `<span class="ml-2">${book.Rating}</span>` : ""}
        </li>
      `,
        )
        .join("");
    }

    displayRandomBooks();
  </script>
</BaseLayout>
